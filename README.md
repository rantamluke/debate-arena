# 🥊 Debate Arena

**Sharpen your mind through structured debate with AI opponents and impartial AI judges.**

## What Is This?

A debate training system where you argue against an AI opponent, judged by 4 independent AI judges who score:
- **Logic** - Argument structure and reasoning
- **Evidence** - Use of facts and examples
- **Rhetoric** - Persuasiveness and delivery

## How It Works

1. **Get a Topic** - Random controversial topic assigned
2. **Pick Your Side** - Or get randomly assigned a position
3. **Voice Your Argument** - Speak naturally (2 min max)
4. **Opponent Responds** - AI argues the other side
5. **Rebuttals** - Back and forth exchange
6. **Judgment** - 4 AI judges score and provide feedback
7. **Win or Learn** - Track your progress, improve your skills

## Why Voice?

- **Real debate skill** - Speaking, not typing
- **Faster** - Say it in 30 seconds vs 2+ minutes typing
- **Spontaneous** - Can't over-edit, builds quick thinking
- **Engaging** - Feels like actual debate

## Progression System

- **Elo Rating** - Starts at 1000, goes up/down based on wins
- **Topic Mastery** - Track performance by subject
