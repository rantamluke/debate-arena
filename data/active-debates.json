Two, there should be animal rights because we can't treat them like we do and keep them in mass production for meat under horrible circumstances. And that is the reason why animal rights are human rights and very important. And also the animal production causes the global warming. And it's climate change in a negative direction due to the CO2 that is produced. And also with what the animals have to be fed with. It's a burden on the planet and the resources is a waste. So we stick to more plant-based life and veganism and vegetarianism. And the unspeakable suffering of animals is not correct and in order. And they are sentient as I said. And we have to explore more the conscience of animal life. And it is more sustainable for this planet.",
