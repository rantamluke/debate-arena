## Your First Debate

1. **Start:** `/debate`

2. **Opening:** 🎤 Record voice message
   - Argue your position (up to 2 min)
   - I transcribe automatically
   
3. **Opponent Opens:**
   - AI argues the opposite side
   - I spawn an agent to generate response
   
4. **Your Rebuttal:** 🎤 Respond to opponent
   - Address their points directly
   
5. **Opponent Rebuts:** 
   - AI responds to your points
   
6. **Continue:** 2 more rounds each
   - You both give rebuttals and closing statements
   
7. **Judging:**

## The Dopamine Loop

✅ **Instant:** Debate finished → satisfaction
🏆 **Short-term:** Win/Loss verdict → emotional spike
📊 **Medium-term:** Detailed scores → learning
📈 **Long-term:** Elo rating climbing → progression

## What Makes It Addictive

- **Real skill building** - Actual argumentation practice
- **Fair evaluation** - 4 judges, specific feedback
- **Visible progress** - Elo rating tracks improvement
- **Quick sessions** - 10-15 min per debate
- **Voice = natural** - Speak your mind, don't type essays
- **Unpredictable** - Random topics keep it fresh

## Voice vs Text

**Voice (Recommended):**
- Natural and fast
- Builds real debate skill
- Auto-transcribed by Whisper
- More engaging

**Text (Also Works):**
- If you prefer typing
- Same evaluation
- Takes longer

Both are judged equally fairly.
